                    <p>Meghalaya holds significant hydro-power potential, estimated at 3,000 MW, yet only 11.8% has been harnessed. The 2007 Power Policy aimed to establish 24 power plants with a total capacity of 1,440 MW by the 12th plan period, but much of this potential remains untapped. The 2024 Power Policy aims to empower the State through Sustainable Inclusive and Efficient Energy Development. Alongside traditional hydroelectricity, the state is increasingly investing in renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and biomass to diversify its energy mix and promote sustainability. </p>
