The state offers significant avenues for investment with abundant natural resources in terms of flora, fauna, forests, medicinal plants, minerals such as coal, limestone, quartz, feldspar, granite, industrial clay, sillimanite, and uranium. A conducive climate for Agri-horticulture sectors and eco-tourism, untapped hydroelectric potential, human resources, forest resources, mineral resources and the social capital in the village communities are some of the key ones. Several high-value agriculture and horticulture crops viz., Strawberry, Ginger, Lakadong turmeric, Honey, black pepper, Potato, Jackfruit, Pineapple, Areca Nut and various exotic flowers.
